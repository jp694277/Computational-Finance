# Computational-Finance

This is about my computational financial course in Tsinghua University.
My class started from the defination and generator of random variables then end up with greeks for estimating sensitivities.
In the end of the class, I have a final presentation of VRT and RQMC for option pricing.

## General Sampling Methods

Generation of nonuniform random variables.

## Brownian Motions

Generation of browwnian motions and other process in finance.

## Variance Reduction Techniques

Applying VRT to options.

## Qusai-Monte Carlo Methods

Low discrepancy sequences and their constructions.

## Greeks Estimation

Estimating greeks for sensitivities.

## VRT and RQMC for Option Pricing

Combining AV, CV, IS and Sobol sequences to estimate options, including European call/put, Asian athematic average call/put and Asian geometric average call/put.
